# Docker

Docker is an open source platform that makes it easy to create and manage environments. With it, we can package an application or environment inside the CONTAINER.

### Docker Terminal

- `docker ps`: List all containers;
- `docker start id`: Run container;
- `docker stop id`: Stoped container;
- `docker run --name x y`: new container, pulling the image if needed and starting the container;
`-d`: Run in background;
